      "\n",
      "1. **Loading Time**:\n",
      "   - When opening the \"be_apm\" channel, there was a noticeable loading time before the messages were displayed (Screenshot 3).\n",

      "2. **Profile Loading Issue**:\n",
      "   - The profile page had a significant loading time or possibly failed to load during the first attempt (Screenshot 7).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Bug Reporting**:\n",
      "   - The user highlighted and reported a bug on the channel selection screen by marking it with \"BUG\". This indicates a frustration or issue encountered, but the exact nature of the bug was not visible from the screenshots (Screenshots 15 to 18).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "The user session began with the user opening the Instabug application and navigating through various channels, specifically the \"be_apm\" channel. The user browsed through recent messages and attempted to access their profile but faced loading issues. They then continued to interact with threads within the \"be_apm\" channel before attempting the profile access again. Finally, they initiated a bug report by annotating the screen with \"BUG\". The main issues observed were related to loading times and potential reliability problems with profile access. The user appeared to be focused on communication within specific channels and attempted to address a bug in the application.\n"

This indicates a frustration or issue encountered, but the exact nature of the bug was not visible from the screenshots (Screenshots 15 to 18).\\n\\n### Summary:\\n\\nThe user session began with the user opening the Instabug application and navigating through various channels, specifically the \"be_apm\" channel. The user browsed through recent messages and attempted to access their profile but faced loading issues. They then continued to interact with threads within the \"be_apm\" channel before attempting the profile access again. Finally, they initiated a bug report by annotating the screen with \"BUG\". The main issues observed were related to loading times and potential reliability problems with profile access. The user appeared to be focused on communication within specific channels and attempted to address a bug in the application.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1725831953, model='gpt-4o-2024-05-13', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_992d1ea92d', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=870, prompt_tokens=7620, total_tokens=8490))\n"
